# Locus — Claude Working Guide

This file is for Claude Code. It provides the context needed to work effectively
on this project without wasting tokens re-reading everything from scratch.

---

## Project in One Sentence

Locus is a workspace-bound local LLM agent assistant: one app instance = one folder.
The agent navigates the folder via a live file index, uses tools instead of dumping
data into context, and keeps the user in full transparent control of every step.

---

## Owner Profile

- **Background**: C++ / C# / Objective-C / shaders, 15+ years, primarily 3D graphics
- **Performance philosophy**: Extremely performance-conscious. Hates bloated software.
  Instant UI response is a hard requirement — no input lag, no phantom waits.
  Low memory and CPU usage matter. Think "good old software" standards.
- **Control style**: Wants full visibility into what AI is doing. Prefers step-by-step
  control over full automation. High-level thinker, expects AI to do the heavy lifting.
- **Anti-Electron**: Explicitly rejected. Any web-based UI must use OS-provided WebView,
  not a bundled Chromium.
- **Primary editor**: VS Code. Editor context integration (file/cursor/selection) is a
  planned v1.5 feature via a thin VS Code shim.
- **Starting platform**: Windows 11

**How to code for this user:**
- Don't add abstraction layers unless necessary
- Don't pad output with summaries of what was just done
- Prefer direct, efficient solutions — no speculative complexity
- When suggesting architecture, lean toward lean and explicit over framework-heavy
- Treat them as a senior dev — skip basics, go straight to substance

## Current Stage

**Architecture** — no code yet. Key decisions made. Next: design CLI prototype scope.

---

## Key Decisions Made

| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Project name | **Locus** | Unique, precise, workspace-centric |
| Workspace config dir | `.locus/` | Lives inside each workspace root |
| Deployment target | **Standalone app** | Independent of any editor, all use cases |
| Build sequence | **CLI prototype → desktop UI** | Validate hard parts before committing to UI |
| Core language | **C++20** | User's native language, zero runtime overhead |
| Build system | **CMake + vcpkg** | Standard C++ toolchain |
| Index database | **SQLite + FTS5** | Zero config, fast, native C API |
| Code parser | **Tree-sitter** | C library, polyglot, battle-tested |
| File watcher | **efsw** | Cross-platform wrapper (Win32/inotify/FSEvents), future-portable |
| HTTP / LLM client | **cpr + SSE parsing** | Clean C++ libcurl wrapper, streaming |
| LLM backend (v1) | **LM Studio** | OpenAI-compatible REST at localhost:1234 |
| Test model | **Gemma 4 26B A4B** | Modern mid-range consumer GPU model |
| Core deployment | **System tray daemon** | Headless always-on process, frontends attach via API |
| Frontend API | **Crow (WebSocket + HTTP)** | Any frontend, any language, including remote |
| File watcher | **efsw** | Cross-platform wrapper (Win32/inotify/FSEvents), future-portable |
| HTTP / LLM client | **cpr + SSE parsing** | Clean C++ libcurl wrapper, streaming |
| ZIM reader | **libzim** | Kiwix/Wikipedia native format |
| VS Code integration | **Thin shim, v1.5** | ~200 lines TS sends context over local socket |
| Logging | **spdlog** | File sink + stderr, structured levels |
| Threading | **std::thread + std::mutex/queue** | Explicit, no framework |
| Tests | **Catch2** | Unit tests from day one, separate CMake target |
| License | **MIT** | Maximum permissive, community-friendly |

## Open Decisions

| Decision | Status |
|---|---|
| Desktop UI framework | Deferred — decide after CLI prototype proves out |

## Key Architecture Principles (Non-negotiable)

1. **Index is never written by the LLM** — only deterministic algorithmic updates
2. **Tools over context stuffing** — agent fetches what it needs, never pre-loads
3. **Paginate everything** — no full-file dumps into context
4. **Operating transparency** — User sees tool calls, LLM/context state and other operations - nothing executes without user seeing it, everything is transparent
5. **Context window is precious** — always summarize tool results before injection
6. **Instant UI feedback** — streaming responses, no blocking main thread ever

---

## Development & Testing Protocol

**Test workspace**: `d:\Projects\AICodeAss\` — this folder IS WS1. Locus always runs against
itself during development. What Locus indexes is exactly what is visible here.

**After every completed stage:**
1. Build the project
2. Run `locus.exe <workspace_path> -verbose` — the `-verbose` flag enables extended debug logging
3. Exercise the stage's features
4. Quit locus.exe
5. Read `.locus/locus.log` — verify expected behavior, catch errors
6. Fix issues before moving to the next stage

**The `-verbose` flag** must be implemented in S0.8 (CLI frontend). When set:
- spdlog level drops to `trace` (vs default `info`)
- All SQL queries logged
- Every tool call logged with full args and result
- LLM token stream logged
- Index update events logged

This protocol means every stage is validated before the next begins.
No accumulated debt, no "we'll debug it later."

## Token Efficiency Notes

When working on this project's own code:
- Read files before editing (read the specific section, not whole file)
- Use Grep for finding specific patterns before reading
- The architecture docs are the source of truth — don't re-derive what's written there
- This CLAUDE.md file should stay concise — it's a quick-scan reference, not a second vision doc
